## Hello world
Hello, and welcome to my blog! My name is Guilherme, and I am a Machine Learning Engineer passionate about building intelligent systems that make a real impact.

I specialize in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) and have experience developing end-to-end ML pipelines that take models from research to production. I’ve worked on custom chatbot solutions for the financial sector and human resources, leveraging retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and Azure OpenAI Services to enhance responses with enterprise knowledge.

Currently, I work at the Computer Vision Department of the Eldorado Research Institute, contributing to projects that help preserve the native fauna of the Brazilian coastline through AI-powered image analysis.

Beyond my professional work, I enjoy tackling ML side projects, exploring new AI techniques to enhance my skill set.
I also enjoy teaching programming to young students and computing for educational purposes.

This blog is where I’ll share insights on machine learning, software architecture, and AI applications—so feel free to connect and follow along!
